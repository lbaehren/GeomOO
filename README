>>> 1. Introduction

GeomOO is a small educational project for gaining knowledge in the usage of 
a number of programming language. Instead of using the over-used, all-present
"Hello World" example, I decided to rather go for something which also would 
be easy to introduce novices to OO concepts.

>>> 2. Configuration & Build

Though some of the examples are using scripting languages which do not require 
previous compilation, others do - hence some basic configuration and build 
framework is required.

  mkdir build
  cd build
  cmake ..
  make
